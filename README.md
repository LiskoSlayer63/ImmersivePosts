# WORK IN PROGRESS
Im not done!

# ImmersivePoles

Goal is to just give the ability to extend the posts to whatever height you want.

### Something to note
I kinda just wanted the extendable pole back from ![ImmersiveIntegration](https://github.com/UnwrittenFun/ImmersiveIntegration) by UnwrittenFun.
This is my try at it, as of now im struggling with getting the Item to display correctly for the PoleBase, the rest i don't care about.

I havent set a license yet because it isnt ready. But as soon as i get the first functional "version" done i'll add the same license UnwrittenFun used for ImmersiveIntegration!

Stuff like models and textures are like 90% done, but not perfect.

There's still no functionality, that i'll work on now since i cannot for the life of me figure out this whole JSON thing.

### I hate you JSON
If you want to help me with that or other things, AWESOME! You are my hero!

### Heh
Yes i know this readme and by extend this whole repo is chaotic, but i'll "fix" this too at some point.
