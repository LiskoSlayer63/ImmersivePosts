# ImmersivePosts
Goal is to just give the ability to extend the posts to whatever height you want.

### WORK IN PROGRESS
This mod is not fully done yet and still a work-in-progress, and things are possible to change drasticaly as things progress.
Excuse any bugs, typos and other thing that shouldnt be.

### Something to note
I kinda just wanted the extendable pole back from ![ImmersiveIntegration](https://github.com/UnwrittenFun/ImmersiveIntegration) by UnwrittenFun.

This is my try at it.

And as of now im struggling with getting the Item to display correctly for the PoleBase (![JSON](https://github.com/TwistedGate/ImmersivePoles/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/immersivepoles/models/block/extendablepost/polebase.json) and ![Java](https://github.com/TwistedGate/ImmersivePoles/blob/master/src/main/java/twistedgate/immersivepoles/common/blocks/BlockPole.java))
The rest i don't care about since you arent supposed to see them anyway.

Stuff like models and textures are like 90% done, but not perfect.

### Things i currently struggle with
 - JSON Stuff
 - Item Display for the ![PoleBase](https://github.com/TwistedGate/ImmersivePoles/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/immersivepoles/models/block/extendablepost/polebase.json)

### Heh
Yes i know this readme and by extend this whole repo is chaotic, but i'll "fix" this too at some point.
